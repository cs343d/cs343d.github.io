<h2> Course Description </h2>
<p>
This class will cover the principles and practices of domain-specific programming models and compilers for dense and sparse applications in scientific computing, data science, and machine learning. We will study programming models from the recent literature, categorize them, and discuss their properties. We will also discuss promising directions for their compilation, including the separation of algorithm, schedule, and data representation, polyhedral compilation versus rewrite rules, and sparse iteration theory.

<p> <b>Professor</b>: Fred Kjolstad </p>
<p> <b>CA</b>: Caleb Donovick </p>
<p> <b>Lecture Times</b>: Tue, Thu 9:45 AM - 11:15 AM </p>

<p> <b>Lecture Location</b>: Sequoia Hall 200 </p>


<h2> Assignments </h2>

<h3> Assignment 1: MiniAPL </h3>

<h3> Assignment 2: Optimizing a sparse query </h3>

<h3> Essay </h3>

The goal of the essay is for you to find and formulate a problem relevant to
this course (in a very broad sense) that matters to you personally.  The essay
should be about five pages in 11 point font.  It should not propose a solution,
but rather focus on a programming problem and its properties.

<h3> Project </h3>

<h2> Grading </h2>

<h2> Students with Documented Disabilities </h2>
<p> Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty. Unless the student has a temporary disability, Accommodation letters are issued for the entire academic year. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066, URL: https://oae.stanford.edu/. </p>
